# Theoretical Explanation for Array methods 
Array methods are built-in functions in JavaScript (and other programming languages) that allow you to perform common tasks on arrays without the need to write custom loops or logic. These methods provide a higher-level abstraction to work with arrays, making code more concise and readable. Below are the key concepts surrounding array methods:
1.	Functional Nature: Many array methods follow a functional programming approach, meaning they take functions as arguments or return new arrays based on transformations, filtering, or other operations. This minimizes side effects and makes the code more predictable
2.	Mutability vs. Immutability: Some array methods mutate (alter) the original array, while others return a new array and leave the original array unchanged. Itâ€™s important to know the behavior of each method to avoid unintended side effects.
3.	Iterative Methods: These methods allow you to loop over the elements of the array, applying a function to each element. They include methods such as map(), filter(), reduce(), forEach(), etc. These methods eliminate the need for traditional loops by abstracting the iteration process.
4.	Array Manipulation: Some methods are used to add, remove, or modify elements in an array. For example, push() and pop() add or remove elements at the end of an array, while shift() and unshift() work at the beginning. Methods like splice() allow inserting or deleting elements at specific positions.
5.	Searching and Sorting: Array methods like find(), includes(), indexOf(), and sort() are used to search for values or sort the elements in an array based on specified conditions. Sorting is often done by providing a custom comparison function.
6.	Array Transformation: These methods transform the array into a new array or reduce it to a single value. For instance, map() is used to apply a function to every element of the array and return a new array with transformed values. Reduce() combines all elements of an array into a single value by repeatedly applying a function to accumulate a result.
7.	Filtering and Selection: Methods like filter() allow you to create a new array with elements that satisfy certain conditions. This is useful when you want to extract a subset of the original array based on a specific criterion.
In summary, array methods provide a powerful way to manipulate, search, and transform arrays. They abstract common operations into higher-level functions, which makes the code easier to write
