Theoretical Explanation for Modules 

Modules are a way to organize and encapsulate code in programming, allowing developers to separate concerns and create reusable components. In JavaScript (and many other programming languages), modules are used to split the code into smaller, self-contained units, which can then be imported and exported as needed. This concept promotes better code structure, maintainability, and reusability.

##Key Concepts:
1.	Encapsulation:
Modules help in encapsulating functionality by keeping certain parts of the code private while exposing others. This means that the internal workings of a module (its variables, functions, or objects) can be hidden from the outside world unless explicitly exposed, reducing the chance of naming conflicts or unintended usage.
2.	Exporting:
When a module is created, it may contain various functions, classes, or variables. To make these accessible to other parts of the code, they need to be exported.

## There are two main types of exports:
Named Exports: Specific elements are exported using their names, and they must be imported with the same names.
Default Exports: A single default export from a module allows the importing code to name the imported value however it chooses.
3.	Importing:
Other parts of the code can import the values that are exported from a module. Importing pulls in only the functionality you need, helping to reduce the amount of unnecessary code.
Modules can import entire modules or just the specific functions or classes needed, which helps in keeping the code lightweight and efficient.
4.	Module Systems:

## There are two main module systems used in JavaScript:
ES6 Modules: This is the native JavaScript module system introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). It uses import and export keywords. ES6 modules are widely used in modern JavaScript development.
CommonJS: This is the module system traditionally used in Node.js. It uses require() to import and module.exports to export. Although newer JavaScript environments prefer ES6 modules, CommonJS is still used in many Node.js projects.
5.	Separation of Concerns:
Modules promote the idea of separation of concerns by allowing code related to specific functionality to be bundled into separate files. This makes it easier to maintain and modify, as each module handles a distinct part of the program.
6.	Reusability:
Once a module is created, it can be reused across different parts of the application or even in different projects. This reduces redundancy, as common functionality doesnâ€™t need to be rewritten multiple times.
7.	Dependency Management:
Modules allow you to manage dependencies between different parts of the application. By using imports and exports, you can clearly define which parts of the code depend on others, making it easier to track and manage those relationships.

## Importance of Modules:
Maintainability: By breaking code into small, self-contained units, it becomes easier to update and manage. Changes can be made to individual modules without affecting the rest of the codebase.
Testability: Modules are easier to test because they are small, focused units of code. Each module can be tested in isolation, without needing to load the entire program.
Scalability: Modules make it easier to scale an application, as new functionality can be added in new modules without affecting existing code
In summary, modules are a powerful tool for organizing and structuring code, especially in larger applications. They allow for better separation of functionality, reuse, and maintenance, making
